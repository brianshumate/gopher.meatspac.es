/////Dream Logs/////

I was inside a Bulk Barn and had to use the washroom. When I tried to navigate the store, the checkered floors were completely uneven and it was difficult to walk.

I was a bit freaked out, so I just checked my makeup and didn’t use the facility. As I turned around a giant toy clown jettisoned out of the toilet and laughed “huh, whatever”. It wasn’t scary at all.

I washed my hands. As I exited a man was singing, sitting on a chair in front of me. I realized I had known the song and started singing along. It was this crazy experience singing along with a stranger. When we were done he told me not to forget.
